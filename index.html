		<h1> This page was made using html ! </h1>
		<p> At Wild Code School, we do everything with care, frustration (a bit) but foremost and most importantly, we do it with cookies ! Cookies are the special ingredient that makes our school so awesome. </p>

		<h2> Do you want to make your cookies ? Of course you do, let's go ! </h2>
		<p> To make a dozen of cookies (to feed one class of Wilders, at least double the quantities) you'll need: </p>

	<div class='ingredient_list'>
		<h2> The ingredients: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 200 gr flour </li>
			<li> 3 tablespoons of maïzena </li>
			<li> 3 tablespoons of lukewarm water </li>
			<li> 2 tablespoons of vegetal milk (soy, almond, rice...) </li>
			<li> 100 gr sugar </li>
			<li> 60 gr vegetal oil </li>
			<li> 1 yeast sachet </li>
			<li> 100 gr of black chocolat (read the back of the box to avoid milk powder or butter in your chocolate !) </li>
			<li> vanilla extract to taste </li>
			<li> optional but strongly recommended: 100 gr of nuts ( hazelnuts, almonds, coconut...) </li>
			<li> optional n°2: for Hulk cookies, strong looking but soft tasting, you can add 2 teaspoons of matcha powder </li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Now, prepare your nicest apron </h2>
		<p> Now, preheat your oven at 180°C. </p>
		<p> Then, select a large bowl </p>
		<p> Mix your maïzena, water and milk. If you choose the Hulk way, add the matcha powder now. </p>
		<p> Add in the sugar and yeast, mix nice and strong so sugar can start to dissolve </p>
		<p> Add the oil </p>
		<p> Time for vanilla ! </p>
		<p> Add the flour, little bit by little bit, make sure to leave no lumps in the batter. </p>
		<p> Cut the chocolat and nuts in tiny pieces and add them it. </p>
		<p> Use a spoon or your hand to shape the batter and put in on the baking sheet. (We like to form cookies weighting roughly 30gr each, they are nicely sized) </p>
		<p> Put your cookies in the oven and let them be for 10 to 20 minutes, depending of your oven: Tiny, on the counter ovens will need 20 minutes while "real", strong ovens will only require 10 minutes. </p>
		<p> take the cookies out to cool. They must still be soft to the touch when done, they'll harden when cool enough </p>
