		<h1>Welcome to this page dedicated to the Wild Code School's cookies ! </h1>
		<p> At Wild Code School, we do everything with care, love, and if you see you groan and yell at your computers we'll deny it until we're old and wrinkly. But first and foremost, we do it with cookies ! Cookies are the special ingredient that makes our school so awesome. </p>
		<p> Everything is nicer, warmer, shinier with cookies, they soothe the nerves and hug the soul ! We love cookies and we have our special way to make them. </p>

		<h2> Do you want to make your cookies ? Of course you do, let's go ! </h2>
		<p> To make a dozen of cookies (to feed one class of Wilders, at least double the quantities) you'll need: </p>
	</div>
	<div class='ingredient_list'>
		<h2> The ingredients: </h2>
		<ul>
			<li> 200 gr flour </li>
			<li> 3 tablespoons of maïzena </li>
			<li> 3 tablespoons of lukewarm water </li>
			<li> 2 tablespoons of vegetal milk (soy, almond, rice...) </li>
			<li> 100 gr sugar </li>
			<li> 60 gr vegetal oil </li>
			<li> 1 yeast sachet </li>
			<li> 100 gr of black chocolat (read the back of the box to avoid milk powder or butter in your chocolate !) </li>
			<li> vanilla extract to taste </li>
			<li> optional but strongly recommended: 100 gr of nuts ( hazelnuts, almonds, coconut...) </li>
			<li> optional n°2: for Hulk cookies, strong looking but soft tasting, you can add 2 teaspoons of matcha powder </li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class= "tasks">
		<h2> Now, prepare your nicest apron </h2>
		<p> Now, preheat your oven at 180°C. </p>
		<p> Then, select a large bowl </p>
		<p> Mix your maïzena, water and milk. If you choose the Hulk way, add the matcha powder now. </p>
		<p> Add in the sugar and yeast, mix nice and strong so sugar can start to dissolve </p>
		<p> Add the oil </p>
		<p> Time for vanilla ! </p>
		<p> Add the flour, little bit by little bit, make sure to leave no lumps in the batter. </p>
		<p> Cut the chocolat and nuts in tiny pieces and add them it. </p>
		<p> Use a spoon or your hand to shape the batter and put in on the baking sheet. (We like to form cookies weighting roughly 30gr each, they are nicely sized) </p>
		<p> Put your cookies in the oven and let them be for 10 to 20 minutes, depending of your oven: Tiny, on the counter ovens will need 20 minutes while "real", strong ovens will only require 10 minutes. </p>
		<p> take the cookies out to cool. They must still be soft to the touch when done, they'll harden when cool enough </p>
